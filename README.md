# dog_breed_classifier

In this project, I construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) that may classify the breed of a dog from any user-supplied image.

If the picture is a human, the algorithm provides an estimation of the most resembling dog breed for her/him.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook.
